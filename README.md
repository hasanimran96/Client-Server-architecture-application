# Client-Server-architecture-application

This is my project for my System Programming course. 

We were given the task to implement a client server type model where the client gives the commands and the server executes the commands and sends an acknowledgement to the client.

Commands include but not limited to:

add num1 num2 ...

sub num1 num2 ...

mul num1 num2 ...

div num1 num2 ...

run program_name file for the program to open

list | all [this will list the processes in run command]

kill | name | pid | all [this will kill the processes started by the run command]

exit (to terminate the program)
